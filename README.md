# Caradium Add-ons Repository

The Caradium Add-ons repository is a collection of add-ons for [CoreELEC](https://coreelec.org/). They may work with similar forks like [LibreELEC](https://libreelec.tv/) but are unlikely to have been tested.

## Disclaimers

### Keep it legal and carry on

Responsibility for the installation, the configuration and the operation of add-ons of the Caradium Add-ons repository, and for the consequences thereof, lies exclusively with the user.

### System Resources

CoreELEC runs on many hardware, some of which have just enough resources for Kodi. Add-ons of the Caradium Add-ons repository will compete with Kodi for these resources, especially if they are limited. Therefore, consider using appropriate hardware or limiting the number of installed add-ons.

### Support

The add-ons are built with the CoreELEC build system to run on the CoreELEC operating system. The Carardium Add-ons repository is however not otherwise related to the CoreELEC project. Do therefore not expect any support from the CoreELEC project with add-ons of the Caradium Add-ons repository.
